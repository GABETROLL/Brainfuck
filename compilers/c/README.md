# This is the Brainf*** compilers written in C!
- The *main.c* file contains full functionality for a Brainf*** compiler: error messages when there's invalid loop syntax, Usage messages in case the shell parameters are wrong, and the necessary "#include <stdio.h>", "int main(void){", "return 0;}" code to actually make the output work!
- The *shortest.c* file contains the smallest possible compile I could make with the help of the other Brainf*** compilers out in the internet.
## Enjoy! :)
